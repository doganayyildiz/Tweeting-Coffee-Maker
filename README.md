# Tweeting-Coffee-Maker

This project is a tweeting coffee maker.
The Coffe Machine tweets "number of coffee consumed x" when every time you press the button of the coffee machine.

Firstly login to IFTTT account.
Connect webhooks and twitter account.
And create a token because you will need in python code.

I unscrewed the button of the coffee machine. Basically I placed a button. 
I connected the button to rsp pico. Yes... you need a raspberry pi pico. this pico must be w model because necessary to connect to wifi.
Later i wrote this code in python.
Good Luck.
